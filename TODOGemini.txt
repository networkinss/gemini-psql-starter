Make this two projects work with Maven.
https://github.com/networkinss/gemini
https://github.com/networkinss/gemini-psql-starter

Requirements: Gradle, Maven, Docker, docker-compose, postgresql, Java 10.


1. https://github.com/networkinss/gemini
First step is to make it work with Gradle.

It currently fails because it uses tests with a postgresql database.
I configured a postgresql with credentials mentioned in 
gemini/gemini-postgresql/src/test/resources/application.properties

It shall be transformed into a Maven project.

Output shall be a working jar. That jar will be tested with a sample project.

2. Sample project for step 1:
https://github.com/networkinss/gemini-psql-starter
It shall be transformed into a Maven project.

It has a local reference in the pom.xml in folder libs.
The jar built in step 1 shall be put there.
Make the project compile correctly.

This sample project shall become a spring boot application.
That might conflict with the library from step 1 and has to be checked.
